# 6.18.0

## New Features

* Add startover timeline type for DASH which supports seeking back to the start
  of the stream. Enable this timeline mode by configuring
  `manifest.timeline.type: "startover"` for startover streams.
* Make Widevine key system version configurable via `drm.widevineVersion` to allow
  for the selection of experimental key systems such as `com.widevine.alpha.experiment`.
* Support multiple HLS EXT-X-MAP tags in a playlist.
* Upgrade supported version of `youboralib` to 6.8.59. Please upgrade to this version (e.g. `npm i youboralib@6.8.59`).
* Support EXT-X-DATERANGE tags in Live HLS Streams.

## Changes

* Improve DRM logs.
* Fix an issue with segment eviction in startover DASH.
* Fixed handling of same GROUP-IDs across different media types in HLS.
* Fix an event `clpp.events.BITRATE_CHANGED` which wasn't properly triggered.
* Fix session initialization in the Broadpeak plugin.
* Update DRMToday Widevine server certificate.
* Fix reporting of bitrate by Conviva Analytics Plugin.
* Fix crash in repeated calls to `load()` on Tizen 4 and 5.

## Known Issues

* Breaking change of latest [Google Cast SDK Web Receiver version 3.0.0137](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/release-notes#september-4,-2024-november-1,-2024)
  * Causes a regression in audio and subtitle track selection when casting to Chromecast devices. Tracks appear disabled during the casting session.
  * Affects all SDK versions.

# 6.17.1

## Changes

* Fix ABR bandwidth estimation between repeated calls to load.

# 6.17.0

## New Features

* Add support for the `EXT-X-DEFINE` tag in HLS.

## Changes

* Fix `clpp.Player.getTextDisplayer()` API.
* Fix docs of `clpp.Player.setMuted()` API.
* Fix handling of empty attribute values in HLS.
* Upgrade supported version of `youboralib` to 6.8.57. Please upgrade to this version (e.g. `npm i youboralib@6.8.57`).
* Fix a corner case with HLS VOD streams in which `EXT-X-DATE-RANGE` tags are
  not being parsed when program date time is equal to the start of Unix epoch.
* Add support for `EventStream@presentationTimeOffset`
  * If present, `presentationTimeOffset` attribute is now used to calculate the presentation time of Events.

# 6.16.0

## New Features

* Add support for smooth codec switching in multi-codec AdaptationSet scenarios.
	* This support is disabled by default and can be enabled by configuring `config.mediaSource.codecSwitchingStrategy` to `clpp.CodecSwitchingStrategy.SMOOTH`.
	* Smooth codec switching is only supported on platforms compatible with `SourceBuffer.changeType()` and is currently limited to sources that do not require transmuxing. It's also disabled by default on platforms known to have issues with `SourceBuffer.changeType()`; currently, this applies to Tizen 6.0 and 6.5 though the list may be expanded in the future.
  * For more details, refer to [clpp.MediaSourceConfiguration](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp#MediaSourceConfiguration)
    and [clpp.CodecSwitchingStrategy](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp#CodecSwitchingStrategy).

## Changes

* Fix an LL-HLS issue of playback stuck on buffering after first segment.

# 6.15.0

## New Features

* Add `clpp.events.LIVE_TURNED_STATIC` event triggered when a live stream
  becomes static.

## Changes

* Fix an issue with some timeline cue events not being emitted for cues which
  coincide with a gap between media segments.
* Fix an issue with playback of certain multi-period MPEG-TS HLS streams.
* Fix support of VAST Ads of IMA SDK Plugin.

* Improve error handling of the `load()` method.
* Fix an issue on Safari where the player might get paused after seeking to
  the very end of the video.
* Fix an issue with the player going to ENDED state early.
* Fix an issue where Tizen devices misreport AC-3 support for encrypted content.

# 6.14.0

## New Features

* Add support for MPEG-DASH trick mode Adaptation Sets (i.e. those marked with an EssentialProperty descriptor with URL "http://dashif.org/guide-lines/trickmode").
   * If such Adaptation Sets are present in the MPD, they are listed as separate [Tracks](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.Track) by the [clpp.TrackManager#getVideoTracks()](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.TrackManager#getVideoTracks) and marked with the `clpp.Track.trickPlay` flag set to `true`.
   * These tracks and all their renditions are available only for manual selection using methods from [clpp.TrackManager](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.TrackManager).
   * At the moment, trick play tracks are completely ignored by ABR, meaning their renditions are not considered for automatic selection when the normal track associated with this trick play track is active. It is also not possible to enable ABR when the currently active track is a trick play track.
   * For details, refer to the [clpp.Track.trickPlay](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.Track#trickPlay) documentation.
* Add support for forced subtitles.
   * For text tracks recognized as forced [clpp.Track.kind](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.Track#kind) is set to `"forced"`.
   * Added [config.preferForcedSubtitles](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.PlayerConfiguration#preferForcedSubtitles) to prioritize forced subtitles over other text track types when `config.preferredTextLanguage` is also provided.
   * If `config.preferredTextLanguage` is not specified, but the `config.preferForcedSubtitles` is set to `true` we first try to fallback to the language from the currently selected audio track. If there is no audio track, then we fallback to the language of the video track as a last resort.
   * We assume that the forced subtitles are a subset of the full subtitles for the same language, i.e., all forced subtitles events should be included within the corresponding full subtitles. When the normal subtitles are being disabled, the corresponding forced subtitles in the same language are enabled automatically.

## Changes

* Fix issues with live presentation delay when `lowLatencyMode` is `true`.
  * Fix `suggestedPresentationDelay` config option.
  * Make sure presentation delay gets set to 0 by default in DASH.
* Fix support for `timescale` attribute of thumbnail streams in DASH.
* Add Mux Data Plugin method to send custom events using `emit` method
  * For details refer to [Mux Data Analytics Docs](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs/analytics#custom-events)
* Upgrade supported version of Broadpeak Plugin.
  * Minimum recommended version is now v5.0.1-4c69e21. Refer to Analytics Documentation for details.
* Add support for [session precache](https://delivery-platform.broadpeak.tv/smartlib/public/advanced-features/precache/) to the Broadpeak plugin.
  * This fixes issues with client side ad insertion with pre-rolls.
* Fix CMSD header parsing to be case insensitive.
* Fix `clpp.SpeedUpMode` enum missing `DECODER` value.
* Update minimum recommended version of Mux Data SDK to 4.30.0
  * Refer to [Mux Data Analytics Documentation](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs/analytics#mux-data) for details.

# 6.13.0

## New Features

* Add configuration options `cl.api.TrickPlayConfiguration` to control the behavior of trick play.
  * `trickPlay.speedUpMode` to control the mode of trick play `decoder` or `seek`
  * `trickPlay.preferTrickPlayTracks` to control the default selection of trick play tracks
  * `setPlaybackRate` method now accept optional `speedUpMode` parameter [clpp.Player docs](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.Player#setPlaybackRate).
  * For details refer to [trick play configuration](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp#TrickPlayConfiguration).

## Changes

* Fix an issue where specific live/IPR DASH streams get stuck buffering at
  the end of the live stream instead of properly ending.
* Fix the issue introduced in 6.11.0 that causes the player to report error `1007`
  instead of `1001` in case of a network error.
* Emit recoverable error events from player in case thumbnails fail to load
  or wrong configuration is used.
* Improve behavior of Trick Play:
  * Improve fallback to seek mode when native trick play is not supported by platform (negatives rates, high speed trick play modes).
  * Added workaround for Tizen devices, fixing situation when reverse rate played frames forward during trick play.

# 6.12.0

## New Features

* Spatial audio detection and configuration:
  * Added detection of E-AC3 JOC audio content using DD+JOC signaling.
  * Added `clpp.Track.spatialAudio` value to indicate spatial audio content.
  * Added `config.preferSpatialAudio` to support manual prioritization of spatial audio.

## Changes

* Fix support for CR and CRLF line endings on Safari related to configs
  `safari.enableHlsVideoTrackInfo` and `safari.enableMetadata`.
* Fixed position attribute of the `clpp-fill` css class and made it `absolute`
* Fixed issue with typescript types where namespace functions were not exposed
* Fixed issue with ESM module dependencies where required files were not automatically imported
* Fixed issue of fetching extra media segment to account for possible positive drift
  * Added detection of positive drift (difference between manifest and media segment time) and fetch extra media segment only when needed.

# 6.11.0

## New Features

* Add the `clpp.install` API which is now the official API for installing
  components and adding player capabilities. Components can be uninstalled
  via `clpp.uninstall`.
* Add support for TTMLv2 `tts:textShadow` style attribute.

## Changes

* Fix issue when parsing PlayReady PSSH data.
* Make Widevine robustness configurable on Android Chrome.
* Fixed issue when parsing directly embedded PlayReady Header Objects.
* Fix support for multiple parallel player instances.
* Stop using the DASH attribute `minBufferTime` to decide the minimum buffer
  size. Note that the existing config `streaming.rebufferingGoal` should be
  used for that purpose instead.

## Deprecations

* The `clpp.Player.use` and `clpp.Player.remove` API is now deprecated and will
  be removed in version 7.0.0, use `clpp.install` and `clpp.uninstall` instead.
* The third parameter of `clpp.persistent.fetchLicense` is now deprecated and
  will be removed in version 7.0.0, use `clpp.install` instead.

# 6.10.0

## New Features

* Add Tracks original language value from manifest
   * Extend `clpp.Track` with `clpp.Track.originalLanguage` value which contains the original language string as it is present in manifest.
   * For details refer to [Track](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.Track).
* Add support for the `EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` tag in live HLS to the MSE
  player. If the tag is present its value is now accessible via
  `player.getTimelineOffset().seekRangeStartDateTime`. The timeline offset can
  be used to display wall-clock time in the UI like so:
  ```js
  const offset = player.getTimelineOffset();
  if (offset) {
    // Get the wall-clock values for UI
    const position = player.getPosition() + offset.offsetDateTime;
    const start = player.getSeekRange().start + offset.offsetDateTime;
    const end = player.getSeekRange().end + offset.offsetDateTime;
  }
  ```
* Add support for fetching decryption keys from DRMtoday for
  clear-key-encrypted HLS content (`METHOD=AES-128`).
* Add support for Widevine EME configuration options
  * `persistentState` can be configured via the boolean option
    `drm.customData.widevinePersistentStateRequired`
  * `distinctiveIdentifier` can be configured via the boolean option
    `drm.customData.widevineDistinctiveIdentifierRequired`


## Changes

* Added `PlayerSurface` option to control webOS long startup patch `webOSStartupPatch`
  * This patch could cause unexpected behavior for specific player setups.
  * For details refer to [PlayerSurface Configuration](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs/surface#disabling-webos-startup-optimization).
* Fix a glitch where WebVTT XML tags were being displayed along with the subtitle
  text in case of WebVTT subtitles embedded inside of MP4 media files.
* Fix an issue of the `HtmlCueComponent` where some subtitle cues were not begin
  displayed in case of overlaps in segmented subtitles.
* Improve support of discontinuous HLS streams.

# 6.9.0

## New Features

* Add config option `streaming.ignoreManagedMediaSourceStreamingHints` to ignore
  hints generated by Managed Media Source (MMS) `startstreaming` and
  `endstreaming` events. Default `false` optimizes for both performance and
  resource management, particularly in varied network conditions and on
  constrained devices, where managing power consumption and network efficiency
  is crucial. Use with caution as enabling this option could lead to increased
  power usage, making the default disabled setting a safer choice for general
  use cases.

## Changes

* HLS fixes:
  * Fix support for URIs with missing file extensions in discontinuous HLS.
  * Fix sporadic crashes in discontinuous live streams which contain
    thumbnails or subtitles.
  * Fix playback of MP4 streams with large baseMediaDecodeTime values.
* Additional Meta-Data such as accessibility information are no longer
  fetched by default with the Safari Native Player implementation. This
  behavior can be re-enabled by setting `enableMetadata` to `true` in the
  [Safari Configuration](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp#SafariConfiguration).
* Fixed issue with Safaris native track selection where the player would
  sometimes mark the wrong track as selected.

# 6.8.0

## New Features

* Add support for Managed Media Source (MMS).
* Add support for changing initialization sections and encryption in
  discontinuous VOD HLS.
* Add config options `streaming.disableAudioTracks` and `streaming.disableVideoTracks`
  to disable audio and video of the MSE Player (not applicable to Safari or Tizen
  native playback).
* Add config option `drm.ignoreUnrecognizedInitData`. If the player encounters init data
  that cannot be processed (e.g., due to a malformed data payload), it will not pass it
  to the CDM to avoid license requests errors. This option allows to disable this behavior
  and pass the init data even if we couldn't parse it.
* Add IMA SDK support to MSE player on Tizen devices.
  * **Warning!** There are limitations related to analytics reporting for IMA SDK Plugin and SmartTV devices. Refer to the [IMA Plugin](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs/advertising#ima-sdk-smarttv-support) documentation for more information.
* Add Mux Data Plugin support for [Bandwidth Throughput Events](https://docs.mux.com/guides/mux-data-playback-events#bandwidth-throughput-events).

## Changes

* Improve handling of segment duration drift in multi-period content.
* Fix track switching in audio-only content.

# 6.7.0

## Changes

* HLS related fixes:
  * Fix corner cases in the handling of segment byte ranges.
  * Improve playlist validation and support check.
  * Low latency support:
    * Fix playlist validation with respect to `#EXT-X-SERVER-CONTROL:PART-HOLD-BACK`.
    * Fix handling of low-latency playlist segments when low-latency support is
      disabled (It is disabled by default).
* Fixed Chromecast Cast Web Sender track manager issue, restoring the ability to list and change text/audio tracks during casting.

# 6.6.1

## Changes

* Fix methods `clpp.utils.Mp4Parser.children()`, `clpp.utils.Mp4Parser.sampleDescription()`
  and `clpp.utils.Mp4Parser.headerSize()`.
* HLS related fixes:
  * Improve MIME type detection by leveraging `#EXT-X-MAP` tags.
* Fixed issue with some Smooth Streaming playback scenarios where the timeline
  was adjusted but the wrong base media decode time was used.
* Fixed minor issue with Youbora receiving consecutive buffering ended events during
  ad playback. The state was tracked already internally so these events were not
  reported and this has not affect on the data exposed to Youbora. It makes the internal
  implementation more consistent though and is slightly more performant since we are
  saving some calls.

# 6.6.0

## New Features

* Expose accessibility information for audio and text tracks on Safari.
  Note that in order for this feature to work `NAME` attributes
  of `#EXT-X-MEDIA` must be unique in the HLS playlist.

## Changes

* Upgrade supported version of Broadpeak Plugin.
  * Minimum recommended version is now v04.05.01-328cb1e. Refer to Analytics Documentation for details.

# 6.5.0

## New Features

* Add an option for filtering of Youbora error events. Configure a custom
  error filter via the `youbora.errorFilter` config option.
* Add new configuration options of 360-degree video playback `clpp.VrConfiguration`.
  * `vr.sensitivity` sets the mouse/touch controls sensitivity. Must be a positive number.
  * `vr.invertHorizontalControl` inverts the mouse/touch movement for horizontal axis.
  * `vr.invertVerticalControl` inverts the mouse/touch movement for vertical axis.

## Changes

* Upgrade supported version of `youboralib` to 6.8.49. Please upgrade to this version (e.g. `npm i youboralib@6.8.49`).
* Fixed issue with parsing WV PSSH data from Version 1 PSSH boxes
* Fixed persistent license removal
* Added `enableSessionCacheForSkd` as an option to the DRM Configuration.
  We encountered issues with FairPlay in native Safari when SKD initialization
  is used. What happens is that we do received multiple requests for the same
  key request from the native engine and if we are not full-filling the
  requests, it can cause a decryption error.
  The default implementation ignores the session cache and will handle each
  `encrypted` event. In this case, there might be duplicated
  requests triggered by the player for license keys that were already fetched.
  This is done to avoid any potential decryption errors. Setting this option to
  true will enable the session cache also for SKD init data and avoid any
  redundant license requests. **Note** that you might encounter more 3016 decode
  errors on Safari with native playback and SKD initialization when enabling the
  session cache.
* Work around a Safari 16.5 issue where in certain cases HLS live streams do
  not start playback at current time (live edge) as they should, but instead
  they start some time in the past.
* Fix an issue with the import of Broadpeak SDK occurring when code is bundled
  with a bundler, which performs hoisting of import statements (such as Webpack).

# 6.4.1

## **Warning!**
Changes in this release might be breaking for some very specific use cases:
* Removed `clpp.EventBus` from the API. *It is unlikely that this will cause
  any issues, since this API is not intended to be public and is not relevant
  to player functionality.*

## New Features

* Add an option to enable detailed video track info and player stats for HLS on Safari.
  To enable this experimental feature configure `safari.enableHlsVideoTrackInfo: true`.

## Changes

* Fix the `textStyle` config option for subtitle styles.
  * Make sure it always overrides styles embedded in TTML and WebVTT files and any other styles.
  * Make sure `textStyle.edgeType: "none"` config removes any existing text shadow from the subtitles.
* Fix handling of HDR CICP EssentialProperty schemes for DASH streams.
  * Add CICP ColourPrimaries, Transfer-Characteristics, MatrixCoefficients as valid EssentialProperty.
* Fix `ReferenceError` due to unavailable `MediaEncryptedEvent` on Safari < 12.1.

# 6.4.0

## New Features

* Add track accessibility features to the public API for DASH streams (under `clpp.Track.accessibility`).
* HTTP status codes that will not trigger the retry behaviour can now be configured.
  Previously, status codes 401 and 403 were not triggering the retry behaviour. This is still
  the default, but can be changed now in the [AttemptParameters](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.net#AttemptParameters)
  for requests types, and globally by adjusting `clpp.net.DEFAULT_FATAL_STATUS_CODES`. The
  configuration is also forwarded to [clpp.net.Request](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.net#Request)
  and can be adjusted per request using a [RequestModifier](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.net#RequestModifier).
* Add support for Low-Latency HLS.
  * Support for Partial Segments and Preload Hint.
  * Support for Blocking Playlist Reload.
  * Configuration by [Player configuration](https://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs/configuration) property `lowLatencyMode`, defaults to `false`.

## Changes

* Fix timeline of dynamic to static transition in DASH.
* Several improvements of tracks.
  * Fix an issue in DASH where similar `AdaptationSet` tags with distinct `Accessibility` tags where being
  processed as renditions of the same track instead of being treated as two distinct tracks.
  * Fix a corner-case issue where tracks with the same roles but in a different order were being treated as two
  separate tracks instead of a single track with two different renditions.
  * Fix issues with audio track selection when `preferredAudioRole` or `preferredAudioLanguage` is configured.
* Warn when an unsupported version of `youboralib` is supplied to the `YouboraPlugin` and emit
  a recoverable error. Supported versions are 6.8.12 - 6.8.25.
* Fix support for custom styling of subtitles.
* Fix `clpp.utils.obj.merge`.
  * Make sure it merges attributes with values that are DOM `Element`.
  * Fix documentation: `clpp.utils.obj.merge` merges from left to right, not the other way around.
* Improve `clpp.PlayerSurface`.
  * Add `clpp-video` class to the video/media element.
  * Protect PRESTOplay class attributes from modification. This prevents unexpected
    styling issues related to the re-rendering of the video or container element that can
    easily occur when used with React, Vue or similar UI frameworks.
* Improve validation of arguments passed to `clpp.Player`.
* Fix an issue where special kinds of live streams such as IPR (in-progress recording)
  were not correctly classified as live by `Player.isLive()`.
* Fix error reporting for invalid or failing thumbnails (VTT, BIF).
* Improved sync byte search for TS segment start time parsing
* Update metadata `player_name` default of Mux Analytics to `CastLabsPlayer`
* Fix time synchronization issues during sender/receiver switch for Smooth Streaming live streams on Chromecast.
* Dedicated handling for Widevine server certificate requests. We are now logging
  Widevine Server Certificate requests explicitly and set the `licenseRequestType` of
  the `request` to 'certificate-request'.
* Fixed issues with handling key restrictions in different multi period scenarios

# 6.3.0

## **Warning!**
Changes in this release might cause breaking changes for some use cases. Please double-check your current usage of the following:
* `player.getPresentationStartTime()` - For non-live content, this method now returns `null`, instead of the previous `0`.

## Changes
* Fix issues with `YouboraPlugin`.
  * Fix crash when Youbora configuration is not passed via `clpp.Player` constructor.
  * Fix an issue where Youbora plugin stopped reporting events after a call to `setYouboraPlugin`.
  * Fix an issue with the import of `youboralib` and `@castlabs/prestoplay/cl.youbora`
    when used with a bundler which performs hoisting of import statements (such as Webpack).
* Improvements on FPS License management. This release includes several improvements
  related to the FairPlay License management with the Apple Prefixed implementation
  as well as the EME implementation. Handling of multiple license requests is
  improved, and we added a few workarounds that allow us to handle rejected payloads
  better and reduce the number of failed playback attempts which previously
  caused 3016 decode errors.
* Fixed an issue where the initials FPS license request with the EME implementation
  was incorrectly reported as a renewal request.
* Changed the behavior of `player.getPresentationStartTime()`. The method now only returns numerical values when the stream is
  live and the calculation of presentation start time is possible; otherwise, it returns `null`. **Note: potentially breaking change!**
* Chromecast Cast Web Sender & Web Receiver related changes:
  * Fixed time synchronization issues for DASH live streams between cast sender and receiver. The updates address
  problems related to seeking, switching between sender/receiver, and incorrect values returned from SDK during active casting.
  * Fix `player.getDuration()` return value during live stream casting. The function now correctly returns `Infinity`,
  addressing the previous bug where `-1` was incorrectly returned. This fix applies to both receiver and sender sides
  during active casting.
  * Changed the behavior of the `clpp.cast.CastProxy.setContentMetadata()` method. This method now also accepts null, which will clear the metadata.
  * Added the `clpp.cast.CastProxy.getContentMetadata()` method.
  * In an effort to simplify the `clpp.cast.CastProxy` metadata API, we are deprecating the following methods: `setContentTitle()`, `setContentImage()`, `setContentArtist()`, `setContentReleaseDate()`, `clearContentMetadata()`. These methods will still work, but they will be removed in the next release. Please use the `setContentMetadata()` method instead. Refer to the documentation for details.

# 6.2.8

## Changes

* Fix clock sync fallback in DASH.
  * This fixes an issue where one failing `UTCTiming` tag
    cancelled the whole time sync. Now all `UTCTiming` tags are tried one-by-one until one
    succeeds, or if all fail, only then the time sync is cancelled.
  * Warn whenever a clock sync fails. Warn when no UTCTiming elements are found.
    Warn when a direct time scheme (`urn:mpeg:dash:utc:direct:2014`) provides an invalid value.
* Fix `clpp.thumbnails.ThumbnailsPlugin.get()` method, which now returns the correct
  thumbnail at a specific position for BIF thumbnails.
* Change parsing process for dynamic DASH and always perform clock
  synchronization before playback. This fixes issues related to wrong system time.
  E.g. `player.getPresentationStartTime()` is now calculated correctly, even
  when system time is wrong.
* Fix the issue where `player.play()` does not trigger a `clpp.events.AUTOPLAY_NOT_ALLOWED`
  event when Safari blocks the play request due to the 'Stop Media with Sound' auto-play policy.
* Fix `clpp.thumbnails.Thumbnail.element()` method, which now works as expected
  even if the URL of the thumbnail image contains round bracket characters.
* Fix `clpp.thumbnails.ThumbnailsPlugin.get()` method, which now returns the correct
  thumbnail at a specific position for WebVTT thumbnails.
* Fix issue with multiple (unnecessary) license requests triggered.
* Fix the license request/response modifiers for Chromecast Receiver:
  * The `licenseRequest` modifier now correctly indicates the `POST` method instead of falsely reporting `GET` for the `request` object.
  * The `licenseResponse` modifier is now properly awaited when defined as async.
  * Please refer to DRM section in manual for limitations of using request/response modifiers in Chromecast Receiver.
* Improve error logging for `MP4_SIDX_WRONG_BOX_TYPE` code. Now there is an URL, byte-range, size, and a 1kB sample of the erroneous SIDX box provided within the `clpp.Error` optional data.
* Handle FairPlay license loading with EME implementation more consistently and avoid
  redundant license requests.

# 6.2.7

## Changes

* Add `PlayerConfiguration.streaming.relativeTextTimestamp` config, which when
  set to true will force text cue times to be offset by the containing media
  segment start time.
* Add VR plugin for 360-degree video playback. See http://demo.castlabs.com/#/docs?q=clpp.vr.VrPlugin
  for more information.
* Fix appending `merchant` name to the DRMtoday Onboard Fairplay certificate URI.
* Fixed an issue with very rapid loads where the engine will not be released properly

# 6.2.6

With this version we started to publish PRESTOplay to NPM. You can now simply integrate the
player and its modules my installing it as a dependency:

```
npm install @castlabs/prestoplay
```

**Note** that we needed to make some changes to the file names and folder structure of the SDK. In
previous releases we were using `.esm.js` and `.min.js` to differentiate CJS (UMD) and ESM modules. We
needed to change the structure slightly and use `esm` and `cjs` folders now instead while keeping the
actual file names the same.

## Changes

* Introduced API for changing EME implementation to use.
  * Due to that it is now possible to use MSE with encrypted content on Apple
    devices.
  * Please refer to DRM section in a manual for more info.
* Added a `streaming.preferNativeHlsOnSafari` config option to explicitly
  specify should we play HLS content using MSE or native playback.
  * By default, this option is set to `true`.
  * Please refer to Components section in a manual for more info.
* Fix `PLAYER_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED_FILE` issue on Tizen for certain DASH streams.
* Fix startup issue for certain live streams on webOS 6.
* Improved `player.getSeekRange()` for native Safari playback.
* Simplified DRMtoday FairPlay certificate request structure
* Introduce the `PlayerConfiguration.forceWaitForTracks` flag to indicate that
  the load promise should only resolve once data is loaded. This allows the load
  promise to wait until data arrived and the track model is fully initialized.
  Note that, if at all, this is only required for some special cases on Safari
  native playback to make sure that tracks are resolved before load resolves.
  In the regular case the track model is already initialized when the load promise
  resolves.
* Fixed regression on default FPS license response handling. We missed
  a case where license responses should still be base64 decoded.
* Fix seekRange() values for HLS LIVE streams with MSE.
* Fixed issue with DRMtoday and FairPlay integration for multi-key cases
  where the SKD erroneously contains not only a keyId but also an
  asset id
* Added basic TTML to VTT transcoder. This allows to sideload TTML subtitles with
  native text displayer (e.g. iPhone Safari). Be aware that in this iteration we
  skip most of the styling information from TTML, so just text cues are transcoded.
* Added support for manually setting the Widevine Server Certificate in an easy way
* Added support for automatic retries in case a wrong Widevine Certificate was used


# 6.2.5
* ESM files are now compatible with ECMAScript 2015.
* Improved start up time on webOS 4+ devices.
* Broadpeak plugin has been upgraded to version 4.
  * Minimum supported version is now 4.1.1-f5f806. Version 3 does not work
    anymore with current implementation.
* Fix playback of PlayReady protected content on WebOS TVs.
* Fix disabling ABR when selected track/rendition is currently active.
* Upgrade Conviva integration to latest version (v4.5.8)
* Add Verimatrix VCAS component for easy integration with Verimatrix DRM license servers.
* Prevent timeline discontinuity playback issues on webOS 6.

# 6.0.0
PRESTOplay SDK for browsers version 6 has been re-designed from the ground up to
build a faster, more modular, and smaller player SDK. We focused on the core
components of video playback and the underlying media playback engine.

Since the new architecture was only possible with drastic measures, we needed to
adapt and change the previous API. Please, consult the migration guide from our
manual to upgrade from version 5.
